Creme Brulee

Makes 6

2 cups heavy cream
1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
pinch of salt
6 egg yolks, lightly beaten
1/2 cup + 6 teaspoons sugar

1. Preheat oven to 325F. In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, vanilla bean and salt. Warm over medium heat until the surface begins to shimmer, about 5 minutes; remove from the heat.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the sugar until well blended. Slowly pour the cream into the egg mixture, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves. Strain the custard into a large measuring cup. 

3. Place (6) 6-ounce ramekins in a roasting pan. Our the custard into the ramekins. Place the roasting pan in the oven and pour enough hot water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake custards until almost set in the center (it may still wobble a little in the center but will firm up as it chills) about 35-40 minutes. Remove custards from the roasting pan and cool 20 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator and chill 45 minutes or up to 2 days.

4. Preheat the broiler and set ramekins on a baking sheet. Sprinkle each custard with 1 teaspoon of the remaining sugar. Broil the custards as close to the heat as possible until the sugar caramelizes, about 1-2 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes and serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 3 hours. Garnish with fresh berries.
