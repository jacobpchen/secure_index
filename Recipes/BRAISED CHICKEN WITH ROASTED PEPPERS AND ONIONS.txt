BRAISED CHICKEN WITH ROASTED PEPPERS AND ONIONS
Be sure to use delicate, small-leaved basil for best flavor.

Serves 6

12 boneless and skinless chicken thighs
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, minced
2 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon chili flakes (optional)
2 tablespoons minced Italian parsley
2 fresh bay leaves
1 teaspoon salt 
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
8 canned San Marzano tomatoes, diced
1 cup dry white wine
4 yellow peppers, halved lengthwise and seeded
24 basil leaves, torn

1.	Preheat the oven to 400°.

2.	Rinse the chicken under cool water and blot dry. 

3.	Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch sauté pan. Add the chicken in a single layer (no overlapping or it will boil rather than brown) and cook until browned on both sides, turning once, about 5 minutes per side over medium-high heat. Remove to a large ovenproof roasting pan.

4.	Add the onion, garlic, chili, parsley and bay leaves to the oil left in the pan and cook 5 minutes. Add the salt, pepper, and tomatoes and then pour the mixture over the chicken and add the wine.

5.	Place the roasting pan in the preheated oven and bake, covered, for 45 minutes, or until tender. 

6.	Meanwhile, preheat the broiler. 

7.	Place the pepper halves, cut side down, on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet. Broil until the skin is blackened and blistered, about 20 minutes. Wrap in the foil; cool 15 minutes, unwrap, peel and cut into strips. 

8.	Remove the chicken from the oven. Stir the roasted peppers and basil into the chicken, discard the bay leaves, and serve hot, accompanied by couscous with figs and almonds and butternut squash purée.
