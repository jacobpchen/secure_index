Warm Fennel, Lentil and Orange Salad

Serves 6


1 1/2 cups lentils du puy
2 garlic cloves
3 springs fresh thyme
2 (3-inch) strips orange zest
2 bay leaves
6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 1/2 fennel bulb, halved and cut into thin 12 wedges
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 large onion, chopped
2 carrots, sliced
1/4 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 oranges, peeled, cut into segments then halve the segments.
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
salt and pepper

In a large pot, combine the lentils, whole garlic cloves, thyme, orange zest and bay leaves. Add cold water to cover by 4-inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce heat medium-low and simmer lentils until tender but firm, 20-25 minutes. Drain and remove garlic, thyme sprigs, orange zest and bay leave.

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the fennel wedges, season with salt and pepper and cook, until lightly browned and crisp tender, about 2-3 minute per side; remove from skillet. Coarsely chop 6 of the fennel wedges and combine with the lentils. Return the skillet to the heat and add 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add garlic, onion and carrots, season with salt and pepper; cook, until beginning to soften, about 2-3 minutes. Stir in the orange juice and lemon juice; cook 30 seconds. Toss the onion mixture with the lentils, orange segments and parsley. 

Divide the salad into 6 portions and mound on each of 6 plates. Lean reserved fennel wedges against one side of the salad lentils and lean the tuna steaks on the other side.
