Oven Roasted Tomatoes

Makes 6 servings 

12 Roma tomatoes, core removed and halved lengthwise
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon sugar
salt and pepper

1. Preheat oven to 500F. In a large bowl, toss the tomatoes with the olive oil, sugar, salt and pepper. Place tomatoes cut side down on an oiled baking sheet. Bake 40-45 minutes or until tomatoes have softened but still hold their shape (they will collapse as they cool). Remove from oven and cool 10 minutes (or to room temperature) before serving.
