Zucchini Risotto with Sage and Asiago Cheese

serves 6

2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 cups diced zucchini

1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
1 cup finely chopped onion
2 cups arborio rice
2/3 cup white wine
5-6 cups chicken stock, boiling
1/2 cup grated Asiago cheese
2 tablespoons butter
salt and pepper
6 sage leaves minced for garnish

1. In a sauté pan, heat the 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the diced zucchini and sauté, until the zucchini begins to turn golden brown, about 4-6 minutes. Remove the zucchini from the pan and set aside.

2. Heat the 1/4 cup olive oil in a large sauté pan or rondeau over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook, stirring until the onion is translucent. Add the rice, and continue to stir, coating the rice well with the oil and cooking the rice gently until it is translucent.  

3. Add the wine, and cook, stirring, until the wine evaporates.

4. Make sure the stock is boiling, and add it a ladleful at a time to the risotto, stirring and cooking between each addition. Allow each ladleful of stock to be fully absorbed between additions. Continue adding stock and cooking, until the rice is tender but al dente, about 20-25 minutes. 

5. When the rice is tender, add the sautéed zucchini and stir well. Stir in the butter. Season with salt and pepper and add the grated Asiago. 

6. Garnish with the chopped sage and serve immediately.
