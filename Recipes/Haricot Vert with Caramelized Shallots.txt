Haricot Vert with Caramelized Shallots

Makes 6 servings

1 1/2 pounds haricot vert, trimmed
6 tablespoons butter
10 shallots, peeled and thinly sliced, about 4 cups
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon cider vinegar
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
salt 

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add haricot vert, return to a boil, and cook until crisp tender, about 3 minutes; drain and refresh in an ice water bath.

2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the shallots, sugar, vinegar and red pepper flakes; cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 9-12 minutes. Add the reserved haricot vert to the skillet and cook, tossing, until heated through, about 3-4 minutes. Season with salt.
