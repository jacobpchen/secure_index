Amatriciana sauce
 
12oz pancetta (diced)
1 medium onion (sliced)
3 cloves of garlic (minced)
16oz Bucatini
Red Pepper Flakes 
Pecorino Romano
 
In a large stock pot boil water and once the water comes to a rolling boil add the bucatini and cooking according to the instructions on the pasta package.
When the pasta has finished cooking set aside 1 cup of pasta water (important!) drain the pasta and set aside.
Heat a large saute pan over medium heat.
Add Pancetta once the pan is properly heated (should feel warm but not smoking) and cook for 2-3 minutes until the fat starts to render.
Add the sliced onions to the pancetta and cook until the fat is completely rendered and the onions are translucent.
Add garlic to the pan and cook for about 1 minute.
Add the tomato sauce and bring the sauce to a boil then lower the heat and summer until the sauce thickens (approx. 45 minutes)
Add the bucatini to the sauce and about Â¼ cup of the pasta water mix the pasta thoroughly so the sauce can emulsify. Add pecorino romano to taste and add red pepper flakes if desired.
