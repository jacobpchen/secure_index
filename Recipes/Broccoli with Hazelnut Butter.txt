Broccoli with Hazelnut Butter

Serves 6

2 pounds broccoli, cut into 1-inch florets, stems discarded
8 tablespoons butter
2/3 cup chopped blanched hazelnuts
1 tablespoon grated orange zest
salt and pepper

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli and return to a boil; cook until crisp tender, about 2 minutes. Drain broccoli and transfer to a large bowl.

2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the hazelnuts and cook until slightly toasted and the butter begins to brown. Remove from the heat and stir in the orange zest. Pour hazelnut butter over broccoli and toss well to coat.
