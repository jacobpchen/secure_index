Bananas Foster

Serves 6

5 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
4 large bananas, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch thick slices
1/4 cup dark rum
3 pints good quality vanilla ice cream
whipped cream
maraschino cherry

1. In a large skillet over medium-low heat, combine the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. Cook, shaking the skillet until the butter melts and sugar dissolves. Add the banana slices and cook, tossing to coat, about 2-4 minutes. Increase heat to medium and off the heat add the rum. Return to the heat and tilt the skillet to ignite the rum; cook, until the flame goes out, about 30 seconds, cook 1 minute longer. Remove from the heat.

2. Place 2 large scoops (about 1/2 cup) of vanilla ice cream in each of 6 wine glasses or serving dishes . Top  ice cream with 1/2 cup of the warm bananas and sauce. Top with whipped cream and maraschino cherries. Serve immediately.
