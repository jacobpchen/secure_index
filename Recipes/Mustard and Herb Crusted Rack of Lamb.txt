Mustard and Herb Crusted Rack of Lamb

Serves 6

3 cups fresh bread crumbs
1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/2 cup chopped fresh mint
4 cloves garlic
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
3 racks of lamb (24 rib chops total), Frenched
1 1/4 teaspoon salt, divided 
1/2 teaspoon pepper, divided
2 teaspoons canola oil

1. Preheat the oven to 475F degrees. Set a wire rack in a shallow roasting pan; set aside.  In the bowl of a food processor, combine the bread crumbs, parsley, mint, garlic, Parmesan cheese, and mustard, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Process until a fairly smooth paste forms; set aside.

2. Season the lamb with the remaining salt and pepper. In a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil. When oil is very hot but not smoking, add the lamb, in batches, and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer racks to the roasting pan, laying it rounded side (the side with the fat) up. Press the bread crumb mixture onto the rounded side of  each rack of lamb.

3. Roast the lamb until a thermometer inserted into the center of the lamb registers 125F degrees for rare, about 22-26 minutes. Cover the lamb loosely with foil and let stand 5 minutes before carving. Serve 3 chops per person.
