Cranberry Walnut Pear Crisp with Whipped Creme Fraiche

Makes 6 servings

For the filling:
8 pears, preferably Bartlett, peeled, cored and cut into thin slices
1/2 cup sugar
1/3 cup dried cranberries
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/8 teaspoon fresh ground nutmeg
For the topping:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter, diced and softened 

1. Preheat the oven to 375F. Coat (6) 8-ounce ramekins with cooking spray; set aside.

2. In a bowl, combine the pears, sugar, cranberries flour, lemon juice, cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg. Toss well and divide mixture among the ramekins.

3. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, brown sugar, oats, cinnamon and salt. With your fingers work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs and forms clumps when pressed together. Crumble the mixture over the pear filling and place ramekins on a baking sheet. Bake 45-50 minutes or until the pears are tender and bubbly and the top is golden brown. Serve with a dollop of whipped creme fraiche.
