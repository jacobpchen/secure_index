SALMON IN JAPANESE RICE WINE AND SESAME GLAZE 
The salmon is as good at room temperature as it is when it just comes out of the oven. The trick is the nearly burned (let's call them caramelized) scallions on top of the salmon. If you like, you can use striped bass or Arctic char instead of salmon.

Serves 6

1/3 cup sesame seeds
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons rice wine or dry sherry
1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup sesame oil
3 tablespoons minced ginger
2 tablespoons minced garlic
1 and 1/2 cups thinly sliced scallions (green and white parts)
6 skinless, boneless salmon fillets (8 ounces each)

1.	For the sauce: combine all the ingredients except the salmon in a bowl and mix well.

2.	For the salmon: place the salmon fillets in a roasting pan in a single layer. Pour the sauce over them and set aside at room temperature for 1 hour, covered.

3.	Preheat the broiler with the rack about 4 inches below the broiling element. Or, if you prefer to roast the salmon, preheat the oven to 500° instead.

4.	Broil the salmon for 10 minutes or roast it for 15 minutes without turning it. (For safety's sake, don't walk away from the kitchen when broiling or roasting at high temperatures). The scallions will brown and the sauce will reduce. If the sauce is still very liquid, reduce it over high heat in a saucepan once you've transferred the salmon to a serving platter.

5.	Serve the salmon hot, with the pan juices spooned over it, accompanied by sautéed baby bok choy and lemon-scented Basmati rice.
