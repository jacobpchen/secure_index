SAUTÈED CORN CAKES

Serves 6

1 cup flour 
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup fine yellow cornmeal
2 cups fresh or thawed frozen corn
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons melted butter or oil
2 cups milk
1 cup thinly sliced scallions 
Butter or oil for frying 

1. In a large bowl, mix the flour, pepper, salt, cornmeal, and corn.  
2. In a medium bowl, lightly beat the eggs, melted butter or oil, and milk to combine. Pour wet ingredients into dry and mix briefly.  Add in scallions.
3. Heat butter or oil in a large sauté pan.   Drop about 1/4 cup batter per cake into the hot skillet, adding more oil or butter as needed to keep cakes from sticking. Cook until cakes begin to bubble, about 3 minutes, then flip and cook until the other side is golden, 1 or 2 minutes longer.  Keep in a 300 degree oven until ready to serve.
