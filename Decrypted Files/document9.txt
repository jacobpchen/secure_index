CHICKEN BREASTS STUFFED WITH ARUGULA PESTO AND FETA

Serves 6


6 boneless, skinless chicken halves
2 tablespoons olive oil

1.	Make a slit in each chicken breast by cutting a deep horizontal pocket in the side of each breast. Make the pocket as large as you can without piercing the top or bottom of the breast.

2.	Pipe about 2 tablespoons of filling in each pocket.  Season with salt and pepper.

3.	Heat olive oil in a large saut√© pan over high heat.  Add 3 chicken breasts at a time.  Cook for about 5 minutes, or until brown.  Turn breasts over and repeat on other side.  Remove from pan and repeat with other 3 breasts.

4.	Place chicken on a sheet tray and finish cooking in a preheated oven until cooked through, about 15-20 minutes.

5.	Remove from oven and serve with potatoes and tomato salad.
