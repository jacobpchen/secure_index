Thai-Spiced Grilled Filet of Beef
 
serves 6

This is ideally a grilled dish, but if a grill is not available, you can sear or broil the meat too.

2 stalks lemongrass, tough ends trimmed, minced finely
2 garlic cloves, peeled and minced
2 shallots, finely chopped
1 tiny red Thai chili pepper, finely minced
2 tablespoons Thai fish sauce
1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon sesame oil
6 filets mignon, about 6 ounces each
canola oil for sauteeing
Thai basil sprigs for garnish

1.  In a blender or mortar and pestle, combine lemongrass, garlic, shallots, chili pepper, and water. Process to a smooth paste, then transfer to a bowl and stir in the fish sauce, lime juice and sesame oil. Stir well.

2. Place the filets in a shallow baking dish, and pour the paste over them. Allow to marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature.

3. Heat the oven to 450.  Heat a large saut√© pan, grill, or broiler. If searing, coat the bottom of the pan with oil and heat over a high flame. If grilling or broiling, lightly rub the grill or broiler pan with oil.

4. Remove the steaks from the marinade and pat dry on paper towels. Sear the meat on both sides quickly, just to brown the surface, or grill or broil until desired doneness. Remove from the pan and place on a rack set over a sheet pan.

5. If searing, finish cooking the steaks in the oven, until medium-rare, about 6-7 minutes more.
