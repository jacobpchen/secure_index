Serves 6


1/4 cup minced fresh ginger
5 scallions, green part only, chopped and divided
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup orange juice
Â¼ cup lite teriyaki sauce
3 tbs. lemon juice
3 dashes Tabasco sauce
6 (6-8 ounce) salmon filets

1. For the salmon: in a large bowl combine the ginger, 3 chopped scallions, garlic, orange juice, teriyaki sauce, lemon juice and Tabasco; stir well.  Add the salmon to bowl and let marinate 30 minutes, turning at least once. Remove the salmon from the marinade. Strain marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil until slightly thickened, about 4-5 minutes; reserve. Season the salmon with salt and pepper. In a large skillet over medium high heat, heat the oil. Add the salmon and cook 3-4 minutes per side (or until fully cooked). Serve salmon over warm lentil salad. Spoon reduced marinade over salmon filets and sprinkle with remaining scallions.
