Filet Mignon Au Poivre

Serves 6

4 tablespoons whole black peppercorns
2 teaspoons fennel seeds
6 (8-ounce) filet mignons, about 1 1/2-1 3/4 inches thick
salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
1 tablespoon butter
1/3 cup finely chopped shallots
1/2 cup demi-glace or reduce veal stock
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/4 cup cognac or brandy

1. Preheat oven to 350F.

2. In a heavy-duty sealable plastic bag or between 2 sheets of wax paper crush
peppercorns and fennel seeds coarse with a mallet or the bottom of a heavy skillet. With paper towels, pat filets dry; season with salt and coat both sides with peppercorn mixture. In a 12-inch heavy, oven-proof skillet over medium-high heat,  heat oil and butter until hot but not smoking. Add the filets; cook until well browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook 8-12 minutes longer for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to a platter, cover with foil and keep warm.

3. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from the skillet and return to the stove over medium-high heat; add the shallots and cook 1-2 minutes or until beginning to soften. Add the demi-glace and  boil, scraping up browned bits, 2 minutes. Add any juice that may have accumulated on the platter with the filets. Stir in the cream and Cognac and boil until the sauce coats back of spoon, about 1-2 minutes. Season sauce with salt. Transfer filets to individual serving plates and spoon sauce over filets.
