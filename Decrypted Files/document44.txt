SEARED FILET MIGNON IN GREEN PEPPERCORN GLAZE
Opt for dried green peppercorns rather than green peppercorns in brine for a cleaner, sharper flavor.

	Serves 6

	For the filet mignon:
	3 pounds filet mignon, cut into six 8-ounce medallions 
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons chopped rosemary
2 tablespoons minced thyme
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
For the sauce:
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
3 shallots, minced
2 garlic cloves, minced	
2 tablespoons crushed green peppercorns
2 cups dry red wine 
1 cup demi-glace (reduced brown veal stock)
1/2 teaspoon salt

1.	Make the filet mignon: Preheat the oven to 400°.

2.	Rub the filet mignon with the salt, pepper, rosemary, and thyme. Heat a 14-inch pan over a medium-high flame and add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add as many of the filet mignon medallions and sear until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side, turning once. Remove to a roasting rack set over a roasting pan. Don't wash out the pan you used to sear the filet mignon.

3.	Roast the filet mignon in the preheated oven until it registers 145° (or longer if you prefer it well done). Remove from the oven.

4.	While the filet mignon roasts, make the sauce: Add the butter to the pan in which you seared the filet mignon and melt over a medium-high flame. Add the shallots, garlic, and green peppercorns, and cook 5 minutes, or until the shallots wilt. Add the red wine and cook until reduced to one-fifth of its original volume, about 10 minutes. Add the demi-glace and salt and cook until reduced to an almost syrupy glaze, about 10 more minutes. Keep warm.

5.	Place one filet mignon medallion on each of 6 plates. Serve hot, with the sauce, accompanied by a roasted vegetable medley in basil oil and roasted garlic mashed potatoes.
